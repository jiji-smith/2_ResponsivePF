# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

<h2>File list</h2>

  <li>index.html : main page</li>
  <li>aoubtme.html</li>

  <li>card</li>
</ul>


<h3>index.html</h3>
This is the very first page that shows 'Austin City' picutre with social media icons.  The button named "Learn more about me" will take you to aboutme.html page.

<h3>aboutme.html</h3>
This is the page that shows my picture and introduction of myself. The card form is from Bootstrap.  The buttion leads to portfolio.html page.

<h3>portfolio.html</h3>
This page shows portfolio pictures and explanations. Since I do not have actual porfolio that I can link to, so I added random pictures from website and my own picture.

<h3>contact.html</h3>
This page includes contact form from Bootstrap.

From this homework, I learned how to use Bootstrap or other existing code; also understand deeper of CSS functions.
